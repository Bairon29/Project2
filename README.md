# Project2
My website gets an API from comicvine.com which returns a API formatted in json
that contains most of the movies they have in the website. My goal building
this site was to provide the user an option to sign up and login in order to have their
own account. Once they do, they can now see all the movies provided and
can save any movie to they profile. They can delete, ediit and information about
the movie the have saved. The user can also update they own information,
logout and deactivate their acount.
